	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am a professional music theory activist. I tell other people how to write music for the
greater good. I don't have very many friends, because I would never be friends with someone who isn't
at least 10% of my skill level.</p>
	<p>Here's some things you should know about me:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some people write <em>subjectively</em> good music, I write <em>objectively</em> good music</li>
		<li>You'll never see me coming</li>
		<li>Don't mess with me</li>
	</ul>
